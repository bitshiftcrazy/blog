#+title: BitShiftCrazy


* Hi and welcome to my blog :)


  I would tell you what kind of posts you can find here, but let's face it:
  I take pleasure in playing with and modifying my blogging setup
  (Emacs + org-mode â™¥), but not so much in actually writing blog posts.

  So instead I'll tell you what I *plan* to write about here:

  - personal stuff: Linux on "unusual" devices, homemade mini laptops,
    blinky LED wearable stuff, terminal apps no one needs...

  - Emacs stuff

  - Linux stuff: reviews of linux distros I tried, window managers, terminal emulators...

  - random stuff I find on the internet and get excited about: basically the same list as "personal stuff" but
    made by others

  - cooking stuff: recipes, especially Club Mate recipes. Of course with Emacs and org-mode.
    
  - 3D printing stuff: it'll probably be something like "things you *really* shouldn't try"

  - Dungeons and Dragons stuff: of course with Emacs and org-mode

    

  You'll find all that stuff when you click on [[./archive.html][stuff]] (that is, *if* I can ever bring myself to write).
