<h1>Hi and welcome to my blog :)</h1><p>I would tell you what kind of posts you can find here, but let's face it:
I take pleasure in playing with and modifying my blogging setup
(Emacs + org-mode â™¥), but not so much in actually writing blog posts.
</p>

<p>So instead I'll tell you what I <strong>plan</strong> to write about here:
</p>

<ul><li>personal stuff: Linux on "unusual" devices, homemade mini laptops,
blinky LED wearable stuff, terminal apps no one needs...</li>

<li>Emacs stuff</li>

<li>Linux stuff: reviews of linux distros I tried, window managers, terminal emulators...</li>

<li>random stuff I find on the internet and get excited about: basically the same list as "personal stuff" but
made by others</li>

<li>cooking stuff: recipes, especially Club Mate recipes. Of course with Emacs and org-mode.</li>

<li>3D printing stuff: it'll probably be something like "things you <strong>really</strong> shouldn't try"</li>

<li>Dungeons and Dragons stuff: of course with Emacs and org-mode</li>
</ul>



<p>You'll find all that stuff when you click on <a href="./archive.html">stuff</a> (that is, <strong>if</strong> I can ever bring myself to write).
