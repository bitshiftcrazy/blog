<h1>FUZIX on the Raspberry Pi Pico: Installing from Arch Linux</h1><div class="tldr">[TL;DR]  The Raspberry Pi Foundation recently released their first microntroller, the Pico.
And while the Pico can't run Linux unfortunately, it can give you the pleasure of playing with
an old-school UNIX-like system: FUZIX. This post quickly summarizes how to get FUZIX onto the Pico from
Arch Linux.

<h2>Why?</h2><p>If you're unsure why you would want to waste your precious time with installing an old-school UNIX-clone on
a dual-core Cortex M0+ and 264KB RAM beast, let me convince you with my flawless reasoning:
</p>

<p><strong>1. Why not?</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>2. Because we can.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>3. And as someone suffering from Obsessive Compulsive UNIX-itis: every device needs UNIX because it needs UNIX.</strong>
</p>

<h2>How?</h2><p>Shortly after the Pico's release, David Given ported FUZIX to it, you'll find details <a href="http://cowlark.com/2021-02-16-fuzix-pi-pico/">here</a>.
And Alasdair Allan wrote an excellent guide on getting FUZIX onto the Pico <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-get-started-with-fuzix-on-raspberry-pi-pico/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>So this blog post is just a quick summary of the necessary steps when installing from Arch Linux.
</p>

<p><em>(= basically the steps that differ a bit from the guide/datasheet)</em>
</p>

<p>You know, to save you the 15min you'd need to look for and read through the respective Arch Wiki entries yourself...
</p>

<h3>1. Set up the C/C++ SDK</h3><p>Assuming you build FUZIX from source, you'll need a working Pico toolchain.
</p>

<p>The first steps are identical to the description in the <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf">Pico Datasheet</a> in section 2.:
</p>

<p>Create a folder for your Pico stuff, in that folder clone the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git">Pico SDK repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git">examples</a>.
</p>

<p>Next install the toolchain: you'll need cmake as build system and the GNU
Embedded Toolchain for arm.
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">sudo pacman -S cmake arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib base-devel
</code></pre>

<p><em>(Pretty sure you already have base-devel, but just in case ;))</em>
</p>

<p>You can test whether or not everything is setup properly eg. by building the
Blink example (see <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf">Pico Datasheet</a> for detailed build instructions).
</p>

<p>To load it onto the Pico from the command line:
</p>

<p>Connect your Pico to your computer via USB cable (hold the BOOTSEL button while doing so),
get its file path for example with
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">lsblk
</code></pre>

<p>(and then identifying the Pico either by its size or by unplugging and re-plugging
and comparing the output)
</p>

<p>or with 
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">dmesg | tail
</code></pre>

<p>Create a mountpoint for the pico, mount it and copy blink.uf2 onto the Pico,
unmount it when you're done:
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">sudo mkdir /mnt/pico
sudo mount /dev/wherever_your_pico_is /mnt/pico
sudo cp blink.uf2 /mnt/pico
sudo sync
sudo umount /mnt/pico
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Get FUZIX onto the Pico</h3><p>From now on you can happily follow the steps from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-get-started-with-fuzix-on-raspberry-pi-pico/">Alasdair Allan's blog post</a>, until
you reach the <em>"connecting via UART"</em> part:
</p>

<p>You can choose from a number of options to make a connection, I used <em>minicom</em>:
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">sudo pacman -S minicom
</code></pre>

<p>To be able to make a connection without being <em>root</em> you'll have to add
your user to the <em>uucp</em> group:
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">sudo gpasswd -a your_username uucp
</code></pre>

<p>Plug in your Pico and your USB UART connector and find your Pico again as previously
described with <em>dmesg | tail</em>.
</p>

<p>In my case it's <em>dev/ttyUSB0</em>, so fire up <em>minicom</em> with baudrate 115200:
</p>

<pre><code class="shell">minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyUSB0
</code></pre>

<p><em>(Have a look at the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/working_with_the_serial_console">Arch Linux wiki</a> for more information)</em>
</p>

<p>Unplug and plug your Pico to see the FUZIX startup message.
</p>

<p>Then type CTRL-A O to open the minicom settings, navigate to <em>Serial port setup</em> and disable
<em>Hardware Flow Control</em>.
</p>

<p>You're now able to type commands. Set the date and time, use <em>root</em> without password to login
and enjoy ;)
</p>

<p><em>(The most important part of the system can be found under /usr/games)</em>
